### INTRODUCING MYSELFüëã
I'm Yi Jun, originally graduated as a Mechanical Engineer with a solid foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking. My journey into data analytics began during my engineering career when I realized my passion for working with data and uncovering insights that drive business decisions. Over time, I transitioned into data analytics, becoming proficient in SQL, Power Bi, and various data analysis tools through self-study and hands-on experience.

I've since applied my skills across different industries, including e-commerce, finance, construction, and research, where I help businesses make data-driven decisions. I'm eager to continue this journey and am currently exploring opportunities as a Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst, or Power BI Developer.
